# typescript_n1

This repository contains a collection of basic JavaScript utility functions. These functions include operations such as:

- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- String manipulations (uppercase, lowercase, reversing text)
- Array operations (sum, product, filtering even/odd numbers)
- Mathematical functions (factorial, greatest common divisor)
- Random number generation
- Other helper functions (checking palindrome, capitalizing words, etc.)

The code is structured to provide reusable utility functions that can be easily integrated into various JavaScript projects.
